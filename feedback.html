    <p>Hi Kevin,

        Welcome to the program! After reading your 'Who am I' I have some feedback. You do not have to resubmit your file you can just use the feedback given in your website. 
        <br>
        
        In your motivation you explain that you want to use this study to open a lot of doors for creativity and enhancement of different technology like software engineering...  I would like to know what will motivate you in the next year? Is this for example learning how to code or something else? And why does learning to code for example motivate you?
        <br>
        You explain that after your study you want to do something in the software engineering or cyber security field. Do you know what you exactly want to do? Do you have a specific branch and specialization? Like for example a back end software engineer at a electricity company.  And why do you want to work there? I would also like to know what you expect from the HZ to help you make a certain choice?
        <br>
        For you weakness I think it is good that you see that as a weakness because of how fast you finish tasks that this can reduce the quality. But I also think this could be a strength because this makes you punctual! Overall your motivation looks very good an I look forward to get to know you even better in the upcoming year.
        <br>
        Kind regards, Remco Kok
